# [@schedule_notification_bot](https://t.me/schedule_notification_bot)

a telegram bot to remind you of your schedule so you don't forgot about it again.

there's already a telegram bot called [@AlertBot](https://t.me/AlertBot) which do similar things but this bot act more like countdown timer where the user input count timer, this is convenient if you wanted to be reminded 5 minutes from now, or 3 hour from now, not so much if you wanted to be reminded at 12pm sharp today. who bother to count how many minutes to 12pm from now anyway? this bot aim is so user can input the exact time.
